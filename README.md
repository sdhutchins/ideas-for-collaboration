# Ideas for Collaboration

This is a living list of ideas, prototypes, and concepts I’m exploring. These are not polished proposals. I’m sharing them publicly to invite feedback, collaborators, and accountability.

## Ideas

### **labgloss**  
A lightweight CLI and web app to define, track, store, and search for lab-specific terms. Designed to improve onboarding, reproducibility, and communication in both dry and wet labs.

### **SciTask**  
A productivity suite for computational scientists to structure projects using reproducible templates and science-aware to-do lists. Intended to support data analysis pipelines, grant writing, and manuscript workflows.

## Want to Collaborate?

If any of these ideas resonate or if you want to co-design, co-develop, or co-lead, please reach out via GitHub or [email](mailto:sdhutchins@uab.edu). Some of these ideas will become open-source projects, papers, or community programs. I’m especially interested in pairing with researchers, developers, educators, and community builders.
